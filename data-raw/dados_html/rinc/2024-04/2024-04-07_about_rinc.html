					The public confidence in the double blind peer review process and the credibility of published articles depend in part on how conflicts of interest are managed during manuscript writing, peer review and decision making by the editors.
				</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>12.1. </strong>It is mandatory that the author of the manuscript declares the existence or not of conflicts of interest. Even thinking that there are no conflicts of interest, the author must declare this information in the article submission act, marking that particular field.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>12.2.</strong> Conflicts of interest may appear when authors, reviewers or editors have interests that, apparently or not, may influence the development or evaluation of manuscripts.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>12.3.</strong> When authors submit a manuscript, they are responsible for recognizing and revealing financial or other nature conflicts that may have influenced their work.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>12.4. </strong>Authors must recognize all the financial support for the work and other financial or personal connections related to the research. The contributions of people who are mentioned in the acknowledgments for their assistance in the research must be described, and its consent to publication should be documented.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>12.5. </strong>Manuscripts will not be simply dismissed because of a conflict of interest. A statement that there is or not a conflict of interest has to be made.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>12.6. </strong>The ad hoc reviewers must also reveal to editors any conflicts of interest that could influence their opinions about the manuscript, and must declare themselves unqualified to review specific documents if they believe that this procedure is appropriate. In the case of the authors, if there is silence from the peer reviewers about potential conflicts, it will mean that conflicts do not exist.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>12.7. </strong>If a conflict of interest on the part of the peer reviewers is identified, the Editorial Board will send the manuscript to another ad hoc reviewer.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>12.8</strong>. If the authors are not sure about what might constitute a potential conflict of interest, they should contact the Journal’s Editor-in-Chief.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>12.9.</strong> In cases in which members of the Editorial Team or some other member publish frequently in the Journal, it will not be given any special or different treatment. All submitted papers will be evaluated by double blind peer review procedure.
					</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>13. Other information</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>13.1. </strong>The articles will be selected by the Editor-in-Chief and the Editorial Board of the Journal, which will contact the respective authors to confirm the text reception, and then forward them to the two ad hoc reviewers analysis.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>13.2. </strong>The received and not published originals will not be given back.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>13.3.</strong> Authors have the right to appeal of the editorial decisions.
					</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>13.3.1.</strong> They will be granted five (5) days from the date of the final decision of the Editorial Board to appeal.
						</p>
<p>
<strong>13.3.2.</strong> The written appeal must be sent to the e-mail: &lt;revista@ninc.com.br&gt;.
						</p>
<p>
<strong>13.3.3.</strong> The appeal will be examined by the Editorial Board within thirty (30) days.

<p>
<strong>2. ENSURING BLIND EVALUATION BY PEER REVIEWERS</strong>
</p>
<p>
					To ensure the integrity of the blind peer-review for submission to this journal, every effort should be made to prevent the identities of the authors and reviewers from being known to each other. This involves the authors, editors, and reviewers (who upload documents as part of their review) checking to see if the following steps have been taken with regard to the text and the file properties:
				</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>2.1</strong> The authors of the document have deleted their names from the text, with "Author" and year used in the references and footnotes, instead of the authors' name, article title, etc.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>2.2</strong> With Microsoft Office documents, author identification should also be removed from the properties for the file.
					</p>
<p>
<strong>2.3</strong> For PDF files, the authors' names should also be removed from Document Properties found under File on Adobe Acrobat's main menu.
					</p>
</blockquote>
<strong>3. </strong><strong>Copyright Notice</strong>

<strong>5. PUBLISHING ETHICS AND PUBLISHING MALPRACTICE STATEMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
					This journal is committed to ethics and quality in publication, following international patterns of scientific publication. We support standards of expected ethical behavior for all parties involved in publishing in our journal: the author, the journal editor, the peer reviewer and the publisher. We do not accept plagiarism or other unethical behavior. Thus, it follows the guidelines of the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/files/International%20standard_editors_for%20website_11_Nov_2011.pdf"><strong>2nd World Conference on Research Integrity</strong></a>, Singapore, July 22-24, 2010.
				</p>
<p>
<strong>5.1. Duties of Editors:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Publication decision: </strong>The journal’s editor is responsible for deciding which of the articles submitted to the journal should be published. The editor is guided by the policies of the journal's editorial board and constrained by such legal requirements as shall then be in force regarding libel, copyright infringement and plagiarism. The editor may consult with editorial board or reviewers in decision making.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Fair play: </strong>The editor should evaluate manuscripts for their intellectual content without regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin, citizenship, or political philosophy of the authors.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Confidentiality: </strong>The editor and any editorial staff must not disclose any information about a submitted manuscript to anyone other than the corresponding author, reviewers, potential reviewers, other editorial advisers, and the publisher, as appropriate.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Disclosure and Conflicts of interest: </strong>The editor must not use unpublished information in his/her own research without the express written consent of the author. The editor should recuse him/herself from considering manuscripts in which he/she has conflicts of interest resulting from competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or connections with any of the authors, companies, or (possibly) institutions connected to the papers.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Involvement and cooperation in investigations: </strong>The editor should take reasonable responsive measures when ethical complaints have been presented concerning a submitted manuscript or published paper.
					</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>5.2. Duties of Reviewers:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Contribution to Editorial Decision:</strong> Peer review assists the editor in making editorial decisions and through the editorial communications with the author may also assist the author in improving the paper.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Promptness: </strong>Any selected referee who feels unqualified to review the research reported in a manuscript or knows that its prompt review will be impossible should notify the editor and excuse himself from the review process.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Confidentiality: </strong>Any manuscripts received for review must be treated as confidential documents. They must not be shown to or discussed with others.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Standards of Objectivity: </strong>Reviews should be conducted objectively and referees should express their views clearly with supporting arguments.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Acknowledgement of Source: </strong>Peer reviewers should identify relevant published work that has not been cited by the authors. The peer reviewer should also call to the editor's attention any substantial similarity or overlap between the manuscript under consideration and any other published paper of which they have personal knowledge.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest: </strong>Privileged information or ideas obtained through peer review must be kept confidential and not used for personal advantage. Reviewers should not consider manuscripts in which they have conflicts of interest resulting from competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or connections with any of the authors, companies, or institutions connected to the papers.
					</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>5.3. Duties of Authors:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Reporting standards:</strong> Authors of reports of original research should present an accurate account of the work performed as well as an objective discussion of its significance. Underlying data should be represented accurately in the paper. A paper should contain sufficient detail and references to permit others to replicate the work. Fraudulent or knowingly inaccurate statements constitute unethical behavior and are unacceptable..
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Originality and Plagiarism: </strong>The authors should ensure that they have written entirely original works, and if the authors have used the work and/or words of others that this has been appropriately cited or quoted. Plagiarism in all its forms constitutes unethical publishing behavior and is unacceptable.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Multiple or Redundant Publication: </strong>An author should not in general publish manuscripts describing essentially the same research in more than one journal or primary publication. To publish the same article in different journals without informing the editors and having their agreement constitute unethical publishing behavior and is unacceptable.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Acknowledgement of Sources: </strong>Proper acknowledgment of the work of others must always be given. Authors should cite publications that have been influential in determining the nature of the reported work. Information obtained privately, as in conversation, correspondence, or discussion with third parties, must not be used or reported without explicit, written permission from the source. Information obtained in the course of confidential services, such as refereeing manuscripts or grant applications, must not be used without the explicit written permission of the author of the work involved in these services.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Authorship of the Paper: </strong>Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study. All those who have made significant contributions should be listed as co-authors. Where there are others who have participated in certain substantive aspects of the research project, they should be acknowledged or listed as contributors. The corresponding author should ensure that all appropriate co-authors and no inappropriate co-authors are included on the paper, and that all co-authors have seen and approved the final version of the paper and have agreed to its submission for publication.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest: </strong>All authors should disclose in their manuscript any financial or other substantive conflict of interest that might be construed to influence the results or interpretation of their manuscript. All sources of financial support for the project should be disclosed.
					</li>
<li>
<strong>Fundamental errors in published works: </strong>When an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in his/her own published work, it is the author’s obligation to promptly notify the journal editor or publisher and cooperate with the editor to retract or correct the paper.
					</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>5.4. Duties of the Publisher</strong>
</p>
<p>
					We are committed to ensuring that advertising, reprint or other commercial revenue has no impact or influence on editorial decisions.
				</p>
<p>
					Our articles are peer reviewed to ensure the quality of scientific publishing and we are also users of CrossCheck (CrossRef’s plagiarism software).
