				The <strong>Revista Brasileira de Entomologia (RBE)</strong>, created in 1954, 17 years after the foundation of the <strong>Sociedade Brasileira de Entomologia (Brazilian Society of Entomology). </strong>During its five decades, RBE has earned a solid reputation among entomologists in Brazil and abroad. RBE<strong> </strong>is a quarterly journal, publishing original papers in entomology, focusing on systematics, diversity, and evolution of insects. The RBE also maintains sections for short communications, book reviews, and announcements of general interest. Points of view or reviews may be published, by invitation of the Editorial Board. Due to current editorial policies, priority is given to papers with an innovative approach and that represents a more solid contribution to knowledge of focused groups, including a more detailed discussion of thematic fields, under a comparative approach.

<td width="70%">
<p>
					The <strong>Revista Brasileira de Entomologia</strong> (RBE) edited on behalf of the Sociedade Brasileira de Entomologia (SBE), publishes original peer-reviewed papers in Entomology, focusing on systematics, diversity, and evolution of insects. The RBE also maintains sections for short communications, book reviews, and announcements of general interest. Points of view or reviews may be published by invitation of the Editorial Board. Current editorial policies give priority to papers with innovative approach and represents a more solid contribution to knowledge of focused groups, including a more detailed discussion of thematic field, under a comparative approach.
				</p>
<p>
<strong>Declaration of interest</strong><br/>
					All authors must disclose any financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their work. Examples of potential competing interests include employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony, patent applications/registrations, and grants or other funding. Authors must disclose any interests in two places: 1. A summary declaration of interest statement in the title page file (if double-blind) or the manuscript file (if single-blind). If there are no interests to declare then please state this: 'Declarations of interest: none'. This summary statement will be ultimately published if the article is accepted. 2. Detailed disclosures as part of a separate Declaration of Interest form, which forms part of the journal's official records. It is important for potential interests to be declared in both places and that the information matches.
				</p>
<p>
<strong>Submission declaration and verification</strong><br/>
					Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract, a published lecture or academic, that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, including electronically without the written consent of the copyrightholder. To verify originality, your article may be checked by an originality detection service.
				</p>
<p>
<strong>Use of inclusive language</strong><br/>
					Inclusive language acknowledges diversity, conveys respect to all people, is sensitive to differences, and promotes equal opportunities. Articles should make no assumptions about the beliefs or commitments of any reader, should contain nothing which might imply that one individual is superior to another on the grounds of race, sex, culture or any other characteristic, and should use inclusive language throughout. Authors should ensure that writing is free from bias, for instance by using 'he or she', 'his/her' instead of 'he' or 'his', and by making use of job titles that are free of stereotyping (e.g. 'chairperson' instead of 'chairman' and 'flight attendant' instead of 'stewardess').
				</p>
<p>
<strong>Contributors</strong><br/>
					Each author is required to declare his or her individual contribution to the article: all authors must have materially participated in the research and/or article preparation, so roles for all authors should be described. The statement that all authors have approved the final article should be true and included in the disclosure.
				</p>
<p>
<strong>Changes to authorship</strong><br/>
					Authors are expected to consider carefully the list and order of authors <strong>before </strong>submitting their manuscript and provide the definitive list of authors at the time of the original submission. Any addition, deletion or rearrangement of author names in the authorship list should be made only <strong>before </strong>the manuscript has been accepted and only if approved by the journal Editor. To request such a change, the Editor must receive the following from the <strong>corresponding author</strong>: (a) the reason for the change in author list and (b) written confirmation (e-mail, letter) from all authors that they agree with the addition, removal or rearrangement. In the case of addition or removal of authors, this includes confirmation from the author being added or removed. Only in exceptional circumstances will the Editor consider the addition, deletion or rearrangement of authors <strong>after </strong>the manuscript has been accepted. While the Editor considers the request, publication of the manuscript will be suspended. If the manuscript has already been published in an online issue, any requests approved by the Editor will result in a corrigendum.
				</p>
<p>
<strong>Zoobank Registration</strong><br/>
					Since January 2020, the Revista Brasileira de Entomologia has discontinued the publications of its issues in the print form, which means that we are an <strong>exclusively online journal</strong>. In this sense, considering that a great number of papers published by RBE contain taxonomic nomenclatural acts (<em>e.g.</em> descriptions of new taxa), these papers must agree with the Amendment of Article 8 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature 2012 69, 161–169), which requires that:
				</p>
<p>
<strong>Article 8.5.</strong> To be considered published, a work issued and distributed electronically must be registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature (ZooBank) and contain evidence in the work itself that such registration has occurred.
				</p>
<p>
					Accordingly, the Revista Brasileira de Entomologia requires that any manuscript dealing with the description of new species, genera or families, submitted to the journal, must be registered in ZooBank and the name of each new taxonomic name (e.g. new family, genus or species) should be added to ZooBank.
				</p>
<p>
					Authors should do this by creating an account in ZooBank (<a href="http://zoobank.org/">http://zoobank.org/</a>). Once that is done the manuscript and name are registered as follows:
				</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>
						Click on ‘Register content’ in ZooBank. You will first be asked to register the publication in which a new name is being established.
					</li>
<li>
						Authors may initially register information for a publication whose status is recorded as ‘not yet published’, and then revise this to ‘published’ once the manuscript appears electronically.
					</li>
<li>
						Note that the Amendment of Article 8 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature requires that the entry in ZooBank must give the name and Internet address of an organization other than the publisher that is intended to permanently archive the work in a manner that preserves the content and layout. In the case of the Revista Brasileira de Entomologia, either CLOCKSS or Portico should be selected from the drop‐down menu of online archives. The Amendment to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature also states that the entry in ZooBank must give an ISBN for the work or an ISSN for the journal containing it. The online and print ISSN in the case of the Revista Brasileira de Entomologia are filled automatically in the web form field (0085-5626). Note that failure to complete all information listed above will mean the taxon name does not meet the requirements of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature for electronic publications; hence, publication of the manuscript on the journal's website, prior to print publication, <strong>will not represent a valid use of the taxon name</strong>.
					</li>
<li>
						Once the publication is registered, you can register new nomenclatural acts for new taxa. For species, you will need to include the genus name and the species name in the separate form fields. You can repeat this process, adding multiple taxa in the same publication.
					</li>
<li>
						Once the publication and names have been registered, you can search for any of the new names in ZooBank. This brings up a webpage with the new name and the ZooBank identification number for that species, a ‘urn’ number that appears as:
					</li>
</ol>
<p>
<a href="http://urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:XXXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/">urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:XXXXXXXX‐XXXXX‐XXX‐XXXX‐XXXXXXXXXXXX</a> (a series of numbers and letters).
				</p>
<p>
					Note the identification numbers for names include ‘act’ in the sequence number.
				</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>
						If you click on the authors listed in the ‘Publication’ line of the new record you have created, this will link to the publication and give you a ZooBank identification number for that publication, a ‘urn’ register number that appears as:
					</li>
</ol>
<p>
<a href="http://urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/">urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:XXXXXXXX‐XXXX‐XXXX‐XXXX‐XXXXXXXXXXXX</a> (a series of numbers and letters).
				</p>
<p>
					Note the identification numbers for publications include ‘pub’ in the sequence number.
				</p>
<p>
					The ZooBank identification number for the manuscript must be included in your manuscript on the title page of your manuscript submitted to the Revista Brasileira de Entomologia, following the author names and affiliations for your manuscript. <strong>This procedure must be done at the revision of the article proof by authors prior to publication</strong>.
				</p>
<p>
					The ZooBank identification number for each new species should appear at the start of the definition of the new taxon, as below:
				</p>
<p>
<em>Aus bus</em>, new species<br/>
<a href="http://urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:XXXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/">urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:XXXXXXXX‐XXXXX‐XXX‐XXXX‐XXXXXXXXXXXX</a><br/>
					Figure 1; Tables I &amp; II
				</p>
<p>
					(While the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature does not require the species register numbers to be included in the electronic publication, the Revista Brasileira de Entomologia requests this information, to conform with protocols of several other taxonomic journals.)<br/>
					Once your manuscript has been published electronically, please <strong>ensure to update the status of your ZooBank record for the manuscript from ‘not yet published’ to ‘published.’</strong> This will then ensure the name is publicly searchable in the ZooBank database.
				</p>
<p>
					ZooBank has tutorial videos on all steps of the process (creating an account; registering a publication; then registering the new names in that publication): <a href="http://zoobank.org/VideoGuide/">http://zoobank.org/VideoGuide/</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>Important</u></strong><strong>:</strong> The registration of articles and nomenclatural acts is of <strong>total responsibility of authors</strong>. <u>RBE will not claim responsibility for any invalid taxon</u>.
				</p>
<p>
<strong>Open Access</strong><br/>
					This is an open access journal: all articles will be immediately and permanently free for everyone to read and download. The Sociedade Brasileira de Entomologia pays for most of the publishing costs incurred by the journal. Authors are required to pay a publication fee to the Sociedade Brasileira de Entomologia in order to share in the costs of production:
				</p>
<p>
<strong>If the corresponding author is a member of the SBE</strong><br/>
					- Brazilian authors: R$ 650 per manuscript;<br/>
					- Foreign authors: USD 150 per manuscript.
				</p>
<p>
<strong>If the corresponding author is not a member of the SBE</strong><br/>
					- Brazilian authors: R$ 1.500 per manuscript;<br/>
					- Foreign authors: USD 300 per manuscript.
				</p>
<p>
					Permitted third party (re)use is defined by the following <strong>Creative Commons user licenses</strong>: <em>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND) </em>For non-commercial purposes, lets others distribute and copy the article, and to include in a collectivework (such as an anthology), as long as they credit the author(s) and provided they do not alter ormodify the article.
				</p>
<p>
<strong>Submission</strong><br/>
					Our online submission system guides you stepwise through the process of entering your article details and uploading your files. The system converts your article files to a single PDF file used in the peer-review process. Editable files (e.g., Word, LaTeX) are required to typeset your article for final publication. All correspondence, including notification of the Editor's decision and requests for revision, is sent by e-mail.

<strong>Language</strong><br/>
									Please write your text in good English (American or British usage is accepted, but not a mixture of these). Authors who feel their English language manuscript may require editing to eliminate possible grammatical or spelling errors and to conform to correct scientific English may wish to use a professional English language editing service.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>PREPARATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Peer review</strong><br/>
									This journal operates a single blind review process. All contributions will be initially assessed by the editor for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed suitable are then typically sent to a minimum of two independent expert reviewers to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editor's decision is final.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Use of word processing software</strong><br/>
									It is important that the file be saved in the native format of the word processor used. The text should be in single-column format. Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. Most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. However, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. When preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. The electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts. Note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. See also the section on Electronic artwork. To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-
								</p>
<p>
									check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Article structure</strong>
</p>
<p>
									Manuscript length should not exceed 80 pages, including figures. In the case of longer manuscripts, authors should consult the Editorial Board previous to submission.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Subdivision - unnumbered sections</strong><br/>
									Divide your article into clearly defined sections. Each subsection is given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line. Subsections should be used as much as possible when cross-referencing text: refer to the subsection by heading as opposed to simply 'the text'.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Introduction</em><br/>
									State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Material and methods</em><br/>
									Provide sufficient details to allow the work to be reproduced by an independent researcher. Methods that are already published should be summarized, and indicated by a reference. If quoting directly from a previously published method, use quotation marks and also cite the source. Any modifications to existing methods should also be described.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Results</em><br/>
									Results should be clear and concise.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Discussion</em><br/>
									This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Conclusions</em><br/>
									The main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short Conclusions section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a Discussion or Results and Discussion section.
								</p>
<p>
<strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Essential title page information</strong><br/>
<em>• </em><em>Title.<strong> </strong></em>Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible.<br/>
									• <em>Author names and affiliations, including ORCID ID.<strong> </strong></em>Please clearly indicate the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled. Present the authors' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name and, if available, the e-mail address of each author. Author affiliations should be presented in decreasing hierarchical order (e.g. Harvard University, Harvard Business School, Boston, USA) and should be written as established in its own language (e.g. Universit Paris-Sorbonne; Harvard University, Universidade de São Paulo). The <strong>ORCID ID </strong>must be inserted in all authors' profile. To do that go to Update your details , ORCID field; if any of the authors does not have an ORCID ID, it can be registered at <a href="https://orcid.org/register">https://orcid.org/register</a>.<br/>
									• <em>Corresponding author.<strong> </strong></em>Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. Ensure that the e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author.<br/>
									• <em>Present/permanent address<strong>. </strong></em>If an author has moved since the work described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a 'Present address' (or 'Permanent address') may be indicated as a footnote to that author's name. The address at which the author actually did the work must be retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Abstract</strong><br/>
									A concise and factual abstract is required. The abstract should be presented in a maximum of 250 words and state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, References should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). Also, nonstandard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself. Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 5 keywords in alphabetical order. Words already included in the title and abstract should not be used as keywords.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Abbreviations</em><br/>
									Define abbreviations that are not standard in this field in a footnote to be placed on the first page of the article. Such abbreviations that are unavoidable in the abstract must be defined at their first mention there, as well as in the footnote. Ensure consistency of abbreviations throughout the article.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Acknowledgements</em><br/>
									Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.).
								</p>
<p>
<em>Formatting of funding sources</em><br/>
									List funding sources in this standard way to facilitate compliance to funder's requirements:
								</p>
<p>
									Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [grant number zzzz]; and the United States Institutes of Peace [grant number aaaa].
								</p>
<p>
									It is not necessary to include detailed descriptions on the program or type of grants and awards. When funding is from a block grant or other resources available to a university, college, or other research institution, submit the name of the institute or organization that provided the funding.
								</p>
<p>
									If no funding has been provided for the research, please include the following sentence: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Units</em><br/>
									Follow internationally accepted rules and conventions: use the international system of units (SI). If other units are mentioned, please give their equivalent in SI.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Footnotes</em><br/>
									Footnotes should be used sparingly. Number them consecutively throughout the article. Many word processors can build footnotes into the text, and this feature may be used. Otherwise, please indicate the position of footnotes in the text and list the footnotes themselves separately at the end of the article. Do not include footnotes in the Reference list.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Illustrations</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Image manipulation</em><br/>
									Whilst it is accepted that authors sometimes need to manipulate images for clarity, manipulation for purposes of deception or fraud will be seen as scientific ethical abuse and will be dealt with accordingly. For graphical images, this journal is applying the following policy: no specific feature within an image may be enhanced, obscured, moved, removed, or introduced. Adjustments of brightness, contrast, or color balance are acceptable if and as long as they do not obscure or eliminate any information present in the original. Nonlinear adjustments (e.g. changes to gamma settings) must be disclosed in the figure legend.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Electronic figures</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>General points</em><br/>
									• Make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of your original artwork.<br/>
									• Embed the used fonts if the application provides that option.<br/>
									• Aim to use the following fonts in your illustrations: Arial, Courier, Times New Roman, Symbol, or use fonts that look similar.<br/>
									• Number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text.<br/>
									• Use a logical naming convention for your artwork files.<br/>
									• Provide captions to illustrations separately.<br/>
									• Size the illustrations close to the desired dimensions of the published version.<br/>
									•In the case of compound figures or plates (formed by several figures), each internal figure must receive letters and not numbers, so that figures may be cited in the text as “Figure 1a” or “Figure 3c”, for example.<br/>
									• Submit each illustration <strong>as a separate file</strong>.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Formats</em><br/>
									If your electronic artwork is created in a Microsoft Office application (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) then please supply 'as is' in the native document format. Regardless of the application used other than Microsoft Office, when your electronic artwork is finalized, please 'Save as' or convert the images to one of the following formats (note the resolution requirements for line drawings, halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below):<br/>
									EPS (or PDF): Vector drawings, embed all used fonts.<br/>
									TIFF (or JPEG): Color or grayscale photographs (halftones), keep to a minimum of 300 dpi.<br/>
									TIFF (or JPEG): Bitmapped (pure black &amp; white pixels) line drawings, keep to a minimum of 1000 dpi.<br/>
									TIFF (or JPEG): Combinations bitmapped line/half-tone (color or grayscale), keep to a minimum of 500 dpi.
								</p>

									• Supply files that are optimized for screen use (e.g., GIF, BMP, PICT, WPG); these typically have a low number of pixels and limited set of colors;<br/>
									• Supply files that are too low in resolution;<br/>
									• Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Color illustrations</em><br/>
									Please make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (TIFF (or JPEG), EPS (or PDF), or MS Office files) and with the correct resolution. If, together with your accepted article, you submit usable color figures then RBE will ensure, at no additional charge, that these figures will appear in color online (e.g., ScienceDirect and other sites) regardless of whether or not these illustrations are reproduced in color in the printed version.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Figure captions</em><br/>
									Ensure that each illustration has a caption. Supply captions separately, not attached to the figure. A caption should comprise a brief title (<strong>not </strong>on the figure itself) and a description of the illustration. Keep text in the illustrations themselves to a minimum but explain all symbols and abbreviations used.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Tables</strong><br/>
									Please submit tables as editable text and not as images. Tables can be placed either next to the relevant text in the article, or on separate page(s) at the end. Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text and place any table notes below the table body. Be sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in them do not duplicate results described elsewhere in the article. Please avoid using vertical rules and shading in table cells.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>References</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Citation in text</em><br/>
									Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice versa). Any references cited in the abstract must be given in full. Unpublished results and personal communications are not recommended in the reference list, but may be mentioned in the text. If these references are included in the reference list they should follow the standard reference style of the journal and should include a substitution of the publication date with either 'Unpublished results' or 'Personal communication'. Citation of a reference as 'in press' implies that the item has been accepted for publication.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Reference links</em><br/>
									Increased discoverability of research and high-quality peer review are ensured by online links to the sources cited. In order to allow us to create links to abstracting and indexing services, such as Scopus, CrossRef and PubMed, please ensure that data provided in the references are correct. Please note that incorrect surnames, journal/book titles, publication year and pagination may prevent link creation. When copying references, please be careful as they may already contain errors. Use of the DOI is highly encouraged. A DOI is guaranteed never to change, so you can use it as a permanent link to any electronic article. An example of a citation using DOI for an article not yet in an issue is: VanDecar J.C., Russo R.M., James D.E., Ambeh W.B., Franke M. (2003). Aseismic continuation of the Lesser Antilles slab beneath northeastern Venezuela. Journal of Geophysical Research, https://doi.org/10.1029/2001JB000884. Please note the format of such citations should be in the same style as all other references in the paper.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Web references</em><br/>
									As a minimum, the full URL should be given and the date when the reference was last accessed. Any further information, if known (DOI, author names, dates, reference to a source publication, etc.), should also be given. Web references can be listed separately (e.g., after the reference list) under a different heading if desired or can be included in the reference list.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Data references</em><br/>
									This journal encourages you to cite underlying or relevant datasets in your manuscript by citing them in your text and including a data reference in your Reference List. Data references should include the following elements: author name(s), dataset title, data repository, version (where available), year, and global persistent identifier. Add [dataset] immediately before the reference so we can properly identify it as a data reference. The [dataset] identifier will not appear in your published article.
								</p>
<p>
<em>References in a special issue</em><br/>
									Please ensure that the words 'this issue' are added to any references in the list (and any citations in the text) to other articles in the same Special Issue.
								</p>
<p>
									If you manage your research with Mendeley Desktop, you can easily install the reference style for this journal by clicking the link below:<br/>
									http://open.mendeley.com/use-citation-style/revista-brasileira-de-entomologia<br/>
									When preparing your manuscript, you will then be able to select this style using the Mendeley plugins for Microsoft Word or LibreOffice. For more information about the Citation Style Language, visit http://citationstyles.org.
								</p>
<p>
<em>Reference style</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Text: </em>All citations in the text should refer to:<br/>
									1. <em>Single author: </em>the author's name (without initials, unless there is ambiguity) and the year of publication;<br/>
									2. <em>Two authors: </em>both authors' names and the year of publication;<br/>
									3. <em>Three or more authors: </em>first author's name followed by 'et al.' and the year of publication.<br/>
									Citations may be made directly (or parenthetically). Groups of references can be listed either first alphabetically, then chronologically, or vice versa.<br/>
									Examples: 'as demonstrated (Allan, 2000a, 2000b, 1999; Allan and Jones, 1999)…. Or, as demonstrated (Jones, 1999; Allan, 2000)… Kramer et al. (2010) have recently shown …'<br/>
<em>List: </em>References should be arranged first alphabetically and then further sorted chronologically if necessary. More than one reference from the same author(s) in the same year must be identified by the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', etc., placed after the year of publication.
								</p>

								</p>
<p>
<em>Journal abbreviations source</em><br/>
									Journal names should be abbreviated according to the List of Title Word Abbreviations.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Video</strong><br/>
									RBE accepts links to video material and animation sequences to support and enhance your scientific research. Authors who have video or animation files that they wish to submit with their article are strongly encouraged to include links to these within the body of the article. This can be done in the same way as a figure or table by referring to the video or animation content and noting in the body text where it should be placed. Note: since video and animation cannot be embedded in the print version of the journal, please provide text for both the electronic and the print version for the portions of the article that refer to this content.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Supplementary material</strong><br/>
									Supplementary material such as applications, images and sound clips, can be published with your article to enhance it. Submitted supplementary items are published exactly as they are received (Excel or PowerPoint files will appear as such online). Please submit your material together with the article and supply a concise, descriptive caption for each supplementary file. If you wish to make changes to supplementary material during any stage of the process, please make sure to provide an updated file. Do not annotate any corrections on a previous version. Please switch off the 'Track Changes' option in Microsoft Office files as these will appear in the published version.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Short Communications</strong><br/>
									Short notes must report elaborated work that incorporates the same aspects required for full articles (biology, ecology, behavior, systematics, pest management, etc.). Manuscripts of anecdotal nature will not be accepted. Papers that merely report new geographic occurrences, records of species or host associations to new localities in geographical regions that they are already known will not be considered. Short Communications should be prepared as a single text and references, including also an Abstract and Keywords. Do not include subtitles (Introduction, Material and Methods, and Results and Discussion). Figures and tables will be limited to a maximum of 3 objects per manuscript.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Voucher policy</strong><br/>
									RBE encourages authors to deposit voucher and type specimens in public museums or permanent University collections. It is advisable that authors, at time of submission, clearly state in the manuscript where their material is expected to be deposited. Labeling and proper indication of voucher specimens are the authors responsibility.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Authors responsibility</strong><br/>
									Page proofs are sent to the corresponding author and should be returned, with the necessary corrections, at the indicated deadline. Authors are entirely responsible for the scientific content of their paper, as well as for proper use of grammar. Authors are encouraged to look at the latest issues of the RBE to check current format and layout. When submitting a manuscript, authors may suggest potential reviewers. Please include the complete name and electronic address. The choice of reviewers, however, remains with the Editors.
								</p>
<p>
<strong>Proofs</strong><br/>
									One set of page proofs (as PDF files) will be sent by e-mail to the corresponding author or, a link will be provided in the e-mail so that authors can download the files themselves. Please use this proof only for checking the typesetting, editing, completeness and correctness of the text, tables and figures. Significant changes to the article as accepted for publication will only be considered at this stage with permission from the Editor. We will do everything possible to get your article published quickly and accurately. It is important to ensure that all corrections are sent back to us in one communication: please check carefully before replying, as inclusion of any subsequent corrections cannot be guaranteed. Proofreading is solely your responsibility.
